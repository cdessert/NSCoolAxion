111  60     	     	  		:  icore    idec

Note: idec is the number of zone per decade of density in the crust, as used by 
      subroutine grid  (in "precool.f")
      Since Temp is calculated on even zones, i.e., every wo zones only,
      idec should be at least 10
      For the same reason, icore should be at least 100.
